# FatecSouls
Fatec Souls is a website for practicing PHP and HTML through MVC model.

This website was intended to run locally, so the assets are present within the project's directories.
Also, the database is exported in two ways: only the structure to generate it, and only the data to fill it,
you can create your own records or use the ones I've uploaded.
The initial pages envolve a basic create and/or read operation, which you can create or log in your profile,
and the character creation is tied to your user's ID, up to a maximum of 4 (four). The initial idea was to create a website that could visually copy the Dark Souls menus and character creation, which I think I managed to do, but due to my short time to finish the development of this project, it won't be that similar gameplay-wise.
